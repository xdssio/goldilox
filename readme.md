# What is Goldilox?

Goldilox is a one line tool which transform a machine learning solution into an object for production.   
This is in current development, please wait for the first stable version. 

# Installing
With pip:
```
$ pip install goldilox
```

[For more details, see the documentation](www.todo) #TODO

# Key features
* One line from local to production
* Extremely flexible and yet simple to use  
* Technology agnostic
* Missing values, Serialization and other validation


## Vaex First
[Vaex]((https://github.com/vaexio/vaex)) is an open-soruce big data technology with similar API to [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).   
We use some of the Vaex special sauce to allow the extreme flexibility for advance pipeline solutions while insuring we have a tool that works on big data.

## Sklearn support
Any [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) pipeline can be deployed as well.
